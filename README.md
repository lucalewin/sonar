Inspired by [swyh-rs](https://github.com/dheijl/swyh-rs).

## Features

### Available features

This project is currently in early development and there are no features available.

### Future features

- Stream the audio on your computer to your Sonos speakers
- Sync the volume of your speakers with the volume of the PC audio

## Audio latency

When starting the audio is ~500ms late. After some time (~30min) the audio and video is perfectly synced. After ~5min more the audio begins stuttering.
